# VR-locomotion-system "MT-One"
The MT-One (Motion Transmitter) is a new solution for better locomotion in VR. The unique thing about the System is that it is home user friendly. This thanks to the compact size of the system (approx.1.3x1m), low cost and no safety concerns. No other known solution meets similar specifications. As the inventor of the system, I invite you as a maker to join the community and build such a system yourself and develop the concept further.
