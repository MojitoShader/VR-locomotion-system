# VR-locomotion-system
The VR-LS (virtual reality locomotion system) is a new solution for better locomotion in VR. The unique thing about the System is that it is home user friendly. This thanks to the compact size of the system (approx.1.3x1m), low cost and almost no safety concerns. No other known solution meets similar specifications. As the inventor of the system, I invite you as a maker to join the community and build such a system yourself and develop the concept further.

Disclaimer:
I taught myself programming, so don't expect professional code. For a community project, all code will probably have to be rewritten and restructured. Nevertheless, the code works well and should be a good basis for further development. I don't know how to use github yet (working on that), so I just dumped the main code on here.. hihi
